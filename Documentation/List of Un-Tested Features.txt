> Lamprey code is currently disconnected because the Lamprey calibrations are failing
> pose code could be cleaned up to remove Falcon position reads
> merged pose tweaks
> shooter code

> LimeLight heights and angles are wrong (still configured for Rogue and not The Child)
> need to tune the LimeLight pipeline latency (servo)
> LimeLight latency with getpipe magically disappeared but could come back
> LimeLight and LIDAR angles and vertical offsets need to be fixed/integrated with servo control
> LimeLight distance to ball calculations

> defensive driving behavior is not intuitive for the driver
