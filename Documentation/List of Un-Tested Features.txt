> new azimuth code w/o an absolute encoder
> still need to confirm azimuth behavior during a brown-out event




> confirm LIDAR and LimeLight distance calibrations
> test full sensor-fusion code
> test LIDAR fault detection code

> shooter fixed-position setpoints need to be tuned
> generate the targeting computer CSV

> tune autonomous PID controllers
> no auto plays are currently tested or tuned

> configure climber (kicker) motor current limit switching

> systems check (Zebra auto play) and the associated wait-VIs has not been tested yet
> defensive driving code has not been tested yet
> LimeLight ball tracking code is in place but disabled
